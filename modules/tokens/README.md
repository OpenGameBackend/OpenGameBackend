## FAQ

### Why not use JWTs?

**Performance**

JWTs are often touted as better performing since you can cryptographically
validate them. However, you still need to check the database to see if the token
is expired, which is just as slow as handling normal tokens. Opt for better
caching.

**Simplicity**

JWTs require handling & rotating a private key, in addition to being able to
blacklist tokens in case of a leaked private key. This is cumbersome and error
prone.

**Length**

JWTs are _long_ and are cumbersome to copy & paste. Database-backed tokens can
store unlimited metadata.
