## Structuring State

### Optimize state for persistence

Pretend that state is a JSON file that's persisted to disk. Expect the format to change over time.

Instead of reading/writing to state directly, write getters and setters that modify the state.

### Versioning state for complex use cases

## Performance Tips

### Do as little work on the actor as possible

Opt to run as many database queries and other expensive operations on the request before sending a message to the actor.

Scripts scale horizontally while actors can be a performance bottleneck if misused.
