## Errors

- **Lobby Already Ready** (`lobby_already_ready`) Lobby already set as ready.
- **Lobby Create Missing Players** (`lobby_create_missing_players`) When creating a lobby with `config.lobbies.autoDestroyWhenEmpty`, a lobby must be created with players in order to avoid creating an empty lobby.
- **Lobby Full** (`lobby_full`) No more players can join this lobby.
- **Lobby Not Found** (`lobby_not_found`) Lobby not found.
- **More Players Than Max** (`more_players_than_max`) More players were passed to the create lobby than the number of max players in a lobby.
- **No Matching Lobbies** (`no_matching_lobbies`) No lobbies matched the given query.
- **Player Already Connected** (`player_already_connected`) The player has already connected to this server. This error helps mitigate botting attacks by only allowing one scoket to connect to a game server for every player.
- **Player Disconnected** (`player_disconnected`) The player has already disconnected from the server. Create a new player for the specified lobby using the `join` script.
- **Too Many Players For IP** (`too_many_players_for_ip`) The player has too many existing players for the given IP.
